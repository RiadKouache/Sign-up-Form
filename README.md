# Sign-up-Form

In this project i build a webpage containing Sign-up form for an imaginary service!
The page has two sections : side-bar section containing the background image, logo, and credit to the creator of the image ; main section where the form is included.

The submit button and password validation do not work because the webpage was builded only with html and css => The goal : practice this two technologies with their new property and concepts that i learned with the Odin Project.
